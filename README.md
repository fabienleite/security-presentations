## Top 10 OWASP Hack2G2 (march 2018)

A presentation of the OWASP Top 10 2017, what it is, why it exists and how to use it.
I presented it for [Hack2G2](https://hack2g2.fr/) which is an organisation that aims to spread knowledge and that is located in south Britanny.

It is meant to be presented to a public that has a real knowledge in developpement and at least basics of web developpement. The inital target was developpers, IT students and IT security specialists on other fields.

I tried to have a "by the example" approach on this one to make it more interactive and to implicate the public.
